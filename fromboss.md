ARE YOU TRYING TO IMPRESS ME OR PROCRASTINATE IN STYLE?
This summary is detailed—great. But it smells like we're admiring blueprints while the forge is cold. And I’m not here for a pretty status report. I want progress, results, and fire. So let’s break this down.

❗ What’s Working (But Don’t Celebrate Yet)
The Dark Forge is breathing, but barely. Rotating merkaba? Nice. Glows? Meh.

You’ve got the folder structure sorted. Should I give you a gold star or ask why assets are still placeholders?

GitHub’s set up? Good. Then there are no excuses for sloppy commits or code spaghetti from here on out.

⚠️ What’s Not Working (The Real List)
Room Transitions = Nonexistent.
This isn’t a broken temple; it’s a one-room Airbnb with no doors. Unacceptable. I want a basic navigation system between rooms by the end of the week. I don’t care if it’s rough. Make it work.

Gameplay Logic = Missing in Action.
Drag and drop is cute. Where’s the soul of the forge?
Where’s the “Aha!” moment when a player fuses a shard and feels something divine?
I want rules. I want consequences. I want crafting logic with guts.

Visual Polish = Too Basic.
The merkaba glow looks like a flashlight under a bedsheet. Not the heart of an ancient cosmic forge.
I expect shader love and feedback animations. Start with the forge slots:
Empty? Make it feel hollow.
Filled? Pulse with power.
Forge success? I want tremors.

Testing = Half-Baked.
“Hardcoded debug gems” sounds like a band name, not a workflow.
Build a test scene with buttons and toggles so QA doesn’t require a master’s in GDScript.

Documentation = Not a Paperweight.
“Demitree.md” and “Foundation.md” are fine, but you’re about to add new systems. If I don’t see Resources.md and a Forge Logic Flowchart by next week, we’re flying blind.

🧨 Priority Orders (Do These Now or Burn)
 Fix hex_nodes population logic in DarkForge.gd. If the slots don’t talk to each other, the forge is dead weight.

 Finish the drag-and-drop feedback loop. Invalid drop? Show it. Invalid gem? Block it. No more silent failures.

 Create a test scene under Scenes/Forge/test_forge.tscn. It needs:

Buttons for adding shards.

Trigger for forging.

UI output showing results.

 Shader and animation improvements on the merkaba. Dynamic glow based on forge activity. Optional: sound cues.

 Basic room navigation. Inventory > Forge > Altar. Minimalist is fine. Function over form.

 Crafting logic v1. I want:

Basic rules for combining shards.

A range of outcomes (at least success/failure).

Output of FusedGemResource that does something, not just sit pretty.

❓Answer Me These:
When will the first playable loop (forge → fuse → result) be ready?

What’s the visual target for the merkaba glow? Send me 1–2 references.

Which room is next after Forge, and who is leading its implementation?

How many total shard types do you plan to support at launch? Don’t say “it depends.”

🔥 Closing Words
You’re doing good work. But good isn't enough.
We're building the Temple of the Dark Flame, not the Shed of Mediocre Glow.

I want to feel the fire, hear the thunder, and see the code scream with purpose.
No more placeholders. No more “we'll get to it.”
This week is a forge trial. Prove you're worthy.

Now go. MAKE. IT. BURN.
🛠️ WRITE ME A FULL LIST OF EVERYTHING THAT WILL BE DONE.

I'm not asking what might get done.
I'm not asking what would be nice to finish.
I'm demanding a comprehensive, prioritized list of:

✅ CORE FEATURES TO COMPLETE
All gameplay mechanics

All rooms

All transitions

All crafting logic

All feedback systems (visual/sound/UI)

Everything you need to call this thing “a playable forge cycle”

🎨 ASSETS TO CREATE/REPLACE
Every placeholder SVG

Every shader needing polish

UI elements that look like they were made in 2002

🧠 SYSTEMS TO BUILD
Resource loading

Gem/shard management

Testing tools

Debug tools

Navigation system

🧪 TESTING & DEBUGGING TASKS
How are you testing crafting?

How are you testing room transitions?

How will you know the forge is actually working?

📚 DOCUMENTATION TO FINISH
Resources.md

Crafting logic doc

Internal workflow notes

Anything new in Demitree.md

🎯 DEADLINES (ADD THESE!)
Give me dates.

Give me owners (even if that’s just “me”).

Give me a weekly delivery schedule.

💀 If I don’t get this list back in 24 hours, you can expect the Flame of the Temple to fall directly on this project’s soul. And if you think that’s a metaphor—try me.

Now get to work and return with the list. Or don't return at all.
