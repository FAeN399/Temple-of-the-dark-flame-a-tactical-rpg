Orientation: Top-down view, with the Entrance Hall at the bottom and the Library at the top.

Corridors: Vary between 4m and 6m wide, with 5m ceilings (lower than the main rooms to emphasize “portal” transitions).

Numbering:

R0: Entrance Hall

R1: Dark Forge

R2: Altar Room

R3: Library

R4: Inventory Room

2. Detailed Room Breakdown
2.1 Entrance Hall (R0)
Dimensions: ~15m (width) x 10m (length), 8m ceiling height.

Purpose:

Main entrance to the Temple of the Dark Flame.

Potential area for tutorials, initial cutscenes, or disclaimers.

Could house initial NPC interactions or story beats.

Architectural Notes:

Large double doors (4m wide, 6m tall) as the main entrance.

Ornate “Dark Flame” sigils on the floor.

Lighting: Low, dramatic torches or braziers leading toward the central corridor.

2.2 Dark Forge (R1)
Dimensions: ~20m x 20m, 10m ceiling.

Ceiling: Domed or vaulted for a grand, mystical feel.

Centerpiece:

Hexagonal Forge Platform (Approx. 6m diameter) in the center.

A rotating Merkaba (approx. 2m tall, 1m radius) floating above the forge.

Hex Slots:

6 Forge Slots, each ~1m from the center, arranged in a perfect hex circle.

Slot diameter ~0.8m, shaped like a hexagon.

Interactive lighting or glow indicates slot states (Empty, Hover, Drop Target, Filled).

Function:

Central gameplay mechanic for fusing gems/shards.

Will have specialized UI or in-world interactive elements for crafting.

Visual Suggestions:

Floor made of black obsidian with glowing inlays that react when forging.

Wall torches that flicker in unison with the forging process.

Overhead lighting from a large brazier or crystal fixture that highlights the Merkaba’s rotation.

2.3 Altar Room (R2)
Dimensions: ~20m (width) x 15m (length), 8m ceiling.

Purpose:

Ritual or ceremonial space for finalizing fused gems or performing special blessings.

Could connect to story-based events or boss instructions.

Design Elements:

A raised altar (4m x 4m platform) in the center with steps leading up on all sides.

Possible pillars or statues around the walls, each representing a shard element (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Light).

Future Expansion:

Could host puzzle sequences or advanced forging rituals.

2.4 Library (R3)
Dimensions: ~15m (width) x 10m (length), 6m ceiling.

Purpose:

Lore repository, containing tomes about shards, gems, forging rituals, and the Dark Flame’s history.

Gameplay mechanics: Possibly used for research or unlocking higher-tier fusions.

Design Elements:

Shelves lining all walls, plus free-standing bookshelves forming aisles.

A large desk or scriptorium near the entrance.

Dim, mystical lighting—glowing runes or floating candles.

2.5 Inventory Room (R4)
Dimensions: ~10m (width) x 10m (length), 5m ceiling (the smallest, tightest space).

Purpose:

Safe storage for shards, gems, and forging materials.

Allows the player to manage resources before heading to the Forge.

Design Elements:

Rows of locked chests or crystal cases on each wall.

A ledger or “Storage Terminal” for sorting and categorizing items.

3. Corridors and Navigation
Entrance Hall → Dark Forge

Corridor Width: ~6m

Corridor Height: ~5m

Length: ~10m

Decorated with unlit braziers and dark motifs, leading the player from the mundane into the mystic.

Dark Forge → Altar/Inventory

Shared Corridor branching to both rooms.

Width: ~6m to maintain the sense of importance.

Height: 5m, continuing the temple’s corridor theme.

Altar → Library

Narrower Passage: ~4m wide

Height: 5m

Could be lined with ancient inscriptions that hint at the library’s knowledge.

4. Vertical Structure
Ceilings are highest (10m) in the Dark Forge to allow a grand, mystical atmosphere.

Altar Room and Entrance Hall have an 8m ceiling, still grand but slightly less imposing.

Library has a 6m ceiling to create an intimate, scholarly feel.

Inventory is only 5m high to represent a more utilitarian space.

Corridors standardize at 5m tall, making them distinct from the main chambers.

5. Special Focus: Dark Forge Mechanics
Central Merkaba

Shape: Geometric star (double tetrahedron).

Scale: ~2m high, spinning in place above the forge platform.

Function (Gameplay):

Visual indicator of forging status (e.g., glow intensity or rotation speed changes during forging).

Could spawn particle effects (sparks, flame, runic glyphs) when forging is successful.

Hex Slots

Arranged in a 1.5m radius circle around the merkaba.

Each slot is ~0.8m across, with slight illumination or color-coded states:

Empty: Subtle cyan glow to indicate it’s interactive.

Hover/Drop Target: White highlight.

Filled: Gold or amber glow.

Invalid Drop: Brief red pulse or “x” icon overlay.

Forge Platform

Shape: Circular dais, 6m diameter, ~0.2m above the main floor.

Visuals: Obsidian texture with faint runic lines leading from each slot to the center.

Purpose: Focus point for crafting logic and synergy with the merkaba.

6. Materials and Aesthetics
Floors: Polished obsidian or dark marble with glowing insets in arcane patterns.

Walls: Stone blocks carved with occult symbols; occasional braziers or sconces.

Lighting:

Ambient: Dim, moody.

Accents: Magical or flame-based sources that guide the player’s eye to key areas (altar, forge, library shelves).

Color Palette:

Primary: Deep purples, blacks, and charcoals.

Secondary: Glow effects in cyan, gold, green, or red for accent.

Tertiary: Earthy browns or rusted metallic fixtures.

7. In-Game Implementation Notes
Room Scenes

Each room (Entrance Hall, Dark Forge, Altar, Library, Inventory) can be a separate .tscn file in Godot for modular design.

Navigation

Use a simple corridor-based navigation system or a UI-based room selector.

Corridors can be “walkable” or purely transitional triggers.

Performance Considerations

The largest space (Dark Forge) might need LOD or culling if it includes heavy particle and shader effects.

Testing & Debugging

Create “test rooms” or hidden dev teleports to jump between areas quickly.

The forging system can be tested in a minimal version of the Dark Forge scene (test_forge.tscn).

8. Blueprint Summary
Functional Flow:

Entrance Hall (R0) → Player spawns or enters the temple.

Dark Forge (R1) → Core forging mechanic.

Altar Room (R2) → Rituals, advanced fusions, story triggers.

Inventory (R4) → Resource and item management.

Library (R3) → Lore, advanced forging research, additional progression.

Dimensions & Atmosphere:

Each room’s ceiling height reflects its importance and mood.

Corridors unify the design with consistent style.

The layout ensures a clear path from the entrance to the primary forging area, with side rooms branching off for optional or supplementary gameplay.

9. Final Notes & Recommendations
Architectural Consistency

Use consistent motif (Dark Flame symbols, hex patterns) across floors and walls.

Keep corridor widths and heights logically scaled to the grandeur of each room.

Scalability

If future expansions are planned (e.g., a hidden Crypt or Boss Chamber), maintain the same corridor and ceiling proportions to preserve the temple’s internal logic.

Player Experience

Ensure each room has distinct visual and atmospheric cues so players can easily recognize where they are or what they’re about to do.

Incorporate slight color-coded lighting changes or audio cues when transitioning between rooms.

Immediate Action Items

Finalize the forging dais layout and ensure all 6 hex slots are spaced and functional.

Integrate corridor triggers for smooth transitions.

Polish environment materials (obsidian, stone carvings, etc.) for the Temple’s aesthetic.

Blueprint at a Glance

This blueprint ensures you have both a clear physical layout for in-game level design and an architectural vision of the Temple of the Dark Flame. Feel free to adjust exact meter values for game-scale or aesthetic preferences, but this serves as a solid foundation to understand the entire structure in detail.

If you have any additional requests—like expansions, secret passages, or specialized altars—let me know, and we’ll integrate them seamlessly into the temple’s blueprint.
