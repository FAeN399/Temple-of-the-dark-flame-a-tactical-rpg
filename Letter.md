Dear [Boss Name],

I appreciate your direct feedback regarding the progress on the Temple of the Dark Flame. Here is our comprehensive, prioritized action plan to address the issues and ignite the forge:

**What's Working:**
- The Dark Forge is operational—we have a rotating merkaba, hex slots with drag-and-drop, and a solid folder structure.
- GitHub and VS Code are properly configured; our versioning and development environment is reliable.

**Immediate Concerns and Required Actions:**
- **Room Transitions:**
  We are building a minimalist navigation system to connect the Forge, Inventory, Altar, and Library. A basic UI with corridor triggers will be implemented by the end of this week.

- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
  Crafting logic will be developed (forge → fuse → result) with a clear set of rules and outcomes. Our first playable loop is targeted for completion in 3 days.

- **Visual Polish:**
  We will overhaul the placeholder assets (merkaba.svg, hex_slot.svg) and refine shader animations to deliver dynamic glow effects and feedback animations (e.g., tremors and pulse effects for successful forging).

- **Testing and Debugging:**
  A dedicated test scene with buttons, toggles, and UI outputs for forging will be created to facilitate quality assurance. Hardcoded debug gems will be phased out in favor of dynamic resource loading.

**Key Deliverables and Deadlines:**
- **First Playable Loop (Forge → Fuse → Result):**
  Completion within 3 days.

- **Room Navigation:**
  Basic transitions with visual feedback between rooms to be ready in 5 days.

- **Visual Enhancements:**
  Improved shaders and animations for the merkaba and forge slots by 7 days.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  Complete Resources.md and a Crafting Logic Flowchart within 7 days.

**Additional Answers:**
- **Visual Target for Merkaba Glow:**
  We are referencing dynamic glow shaders similar to [Example 1](https://example.com/glow1) and [Example 2](https://example.com/pulse2).

- **Room Priorities:**
  After the Forge room, the Inventory room is next. I will lead its implementation.

- **Shard Types at Launch:**
  We commit to supporting 5 types: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Light.

I am confident that by executing this plan we will transform the forge from a dormant blueprint into the fiery heart of the Temple. No more placeholders—progress will be real, tangible, and intense.

Thank you for your feedback and for pushing us to deliver excellence. I will keep you updated with a weekly delivery schedule of our progress.

MAKE. IT. BURN.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
