# Temple of the Dark Flame - Project Summary

## Current Status
1. **Project Structure**:
   - Folder structure is well-organized and follows Godot's best practices.
   - Key folders include `Scenes`, `Scripts`, `Resources`, and `addons`.

2. **Implemented Features**:
   - **Dark Forge**:
     - Hexagonal layout with 6 slots.
     - Rotating center merkaba with glow effects.
     - Drag-and-drop functionality for placing gems.
     - Visual states for hex slots (empty, filled, hover, drop target).
   - **Temple Scene**:
     - Main temple layout with room management.
     - Initial integration of the Forge Room.

3. **Resources**:
   - Basic gem and shard resources created.
   - Test resources for debugging (e.g., `test_fire_shard.tres`).

4. **Development Environment**:
   - GitHub repository set up: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/FAeN399/Temple-of-the-dark-flame-a-tactical-rpg)
   - VS Code configured with extensions for Godot development.
   - Godot 4.2.1 is being used for compatibility.

## Concerns
1. **Resource Design**:
   - Placeholder assets (e.g., `merkaba.svg`, `hex_slot.svg`) need to be replaced with final designs.
   - Shader effects for glow and animations are basic and may need refinement.

2. **Room Transitions**:
   - Currently, there is no navigation system between rooms (e.g., Forge, Inventory, Altar).
   - Need to implement smooth transitions and UI for room selection.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test gems and shards are hardcoded for debugging.
   - Need a proper system for dynamically loading resources.

4. **Performance**:
   - Rotating merkaba and hex slot animations are simple but may need optimization for larger scenes.

5. **Gameplay Integration**:
   - No gameplay logic for combining gems or shards beyond basic functionality.
   - Need to define rules for crafting and resource interactions.

---

## Next Steps
1. **Finalize Dark Forge**:
   - Add animations for successful forging.
   - Implement crafting logic for combining gems and shards.
   - Create polished assets for hex slots and the merkaba.

2. **Expand Temple**:
   - Add additional rooms (Inventory, Altar, Library).
   - Implement a navigation system for switching between rooms.

3. **UI and UX**:
   - Design a consistent UI theme for the entire game.
   - Add tooltips and feedback for player actions.

4. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Create automated tests for crafting logic.
   - Add debug tools for testing room transitions and resource interactions.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update `Demitree.md` with detailed implementation notes for new features.
   - Write a README for the GitHub repository to onboard new developers.

## Questions for the Boss
1. What is the priority for room development (e.g., Forge vs. Inventory)?
2. Should we focus on gameplay mechanics or visual polish first?
3. Are there any specific design guidelines for assets (e.g., color palette, style)?
4. What is the deadline for the next milestone?

---

## Summary
The project is progressing well, with the Dark Forge and Temple structure in place. However, we need to address resource design, room transitions, and gameplay integration to move forward effectively. Clear priorities and deadlines will help streamline development.

# Boss Feedback and Response Plan

## Boss Feedback Summary
1. **Whatâ€™s Working**:
   - Dark Forge is functional but lacks polish.
   - Folder structure and GitHub setup are solid.

2. **Whatâ€™s Not Working**:
   - Room transitions are missing.
   - Gameplay logic for crafting is incomplete.
   - Visual polish is basic, especially for the merkaba glow and forge slots.
   - Testing is insufficient, relying on hardcoded debug gems.

3. **Priority Orders**:
   - Fix hex_nodes logic in DarkForge.gd.
   - Complete drag-and-drop feedback loop.
   - Create a test scene for the forge.
   - Improve shaders and animations for the merkaba.
   - Implement basic room navigation.
   - Develop crafting logic v1 with rules and outcomes.

4. **Questions**:
   - When will the first playable loop (forge â†’ fuse â†’ result) be ready?
   - Whatâ€™s the visual target for the merkaba glow?
   - Which room is next after Forge?
   - How many shard types will be supported at launch?
